                        Technology has been in my life for as long as I can remember, and thus a large portion of my identity and my interests revolve around technology. The internet alone has given me jobs, friends and countless hours of entertainment throughout my entire life.

                    <p>
                        Iâ€™ve always had a large social media presence. In elementary school my entire grade was getting into Facebook and used it to message one another, play games and share media. To one friend alone In a year I had sent 50 000 messages. Now I still have a large social media presence but mostly for watching short form content that my friends and I send to one another.

                    <p>
                        Video games have been a large component of my life, story games, online games you name it I have probably played them. Video Games offer my friends and I a form of escapism and help us get away from lifeâ€™s troubles. In my early childhood much of my identity was formed from video game characters, I would idolize the protagonist in the game stories and try to be like them.

                    <p>
                        Quite possibly the most valuable part of technology to me has been the connections I have been able to establish via the internet. With all the years I have been on the internet I have met so many amazing people with various backgrounds. Almost everyday for the past 5 years my main friend group has met online in various voice chat apps to play games together, discuss our days and share experiences. Without them I would not be the person I am now.

                        Iâ€™ve always loved building things. I find nothing more satisfying than looking at the result of something I have built. Thatâ€™s why I love coding. From a young age I decided that for my future I want to do something in the field of computer science and ever since I have been in pursuit of that dream.

                <p class="story-content-color">For some it may be hard to see how all this links together. For me, however, everything presented has played a vital role in shaping who I am and guiding me along my journey. Social media gave me a way to communicate with my friends and share information, Gaming offered me a form of escape and allowed me to experience all sorts of different stories and visions, The power of the internet brought me connection with people I may never see in person, and finally if everything goes according to plan I will hopefully have a job in the technology space.</p>
